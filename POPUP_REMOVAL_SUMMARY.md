## What Was Removed

### ✅ **JavaScript Changes:**
- Removed `showResults(result)` method - no more results modal
- Removed `getTrophyTitle(trophyLevel)` method - no longer needed
- Removed call to `this.showResults(result)` from submit logic
- Reduced redirect delay from 3000ms to 1500ms for faster transition

### ✅ **Simplified Assessment Flow:**
1. **Answer Questions** - User completes all 27 sustainability questions
2. **Submit Assessment** - Button shows loading state
3. **Success Notification** - Brief "Assessment submitted successfully!" message
4. **Direct Redirect** - Immediately redirects to dashboard (1.5 seconds)
5. **Dashboard Display** - Shows calculated scores and trophy highlighting

## Result:
